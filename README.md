# README: Credit Scoring Model Development

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank's Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service. The model will assess customer creditworthiness based on data provided by an eCommerce platform, predicting the likelihood of default while ensuring compliance with Basel II Capital Accord guidelines.

## Objectives
1. **Assess Credit Risk:** Understand and quantify the likelihood of borrower default using statistical and machine learning techniques.
2. **Develop a Predictive Model:** Build a robust and interpretable model for credit scoring.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure alignment with Basel II standards for credit risk assessment.

## Key Components
- **Dataset:** Customer data from the eCommerce platform, including demographic, transaction, and repayment history.
- **Target Variable:** Default status (defined as being 90 days overdue on repayments).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.

## Project Tasks
1. **Understanding Credit Risk:**
   - Researched the components of credit risk: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Maturity (M).
   - Reviewed regulatory guidelines from Basel II to define default criteria and risk management approaches.

2. **Data Cleaning and EDA:**
   - Verified the absence of null values.
   - Explored patterns and relationships within the dataset to inform feature selection and modeling.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Researched baseline models such as logistic regression for initial implementation.
   - Explored advanced machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, XGBoost).

4. **Regulatory Alignment:**
   - Incorporated Basel II-compliant definitions and risk measures into the modeling process.

## Progress Summary
- Completed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- No null values detected in the dataset.

## Next Steps
1. Develop and evaluate the logistic regression model.
2. Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques to enhance model performance.
3. Conduct feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
4. Validate the model using cross-validation and additional datasets.
5. Document findings and prepare a final report.


## Contribution
This project is led by the Analytics Engineering team at Bati Bank. Feedback and collaboration from domain experts and stakeholders are highly valued to ensure successful implementation.
